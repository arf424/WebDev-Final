        <p>My name is Arnaldo Roberto Forte, but I go by Arnie most of the time. I am currently a student at NYU's Tandon School of Engineering pursuing a Bachelors degree in Digital Media. I'm from Ridgefield Park, New Jersey, just a short drive away from the city, so I've been surrounded by the culture of New York my whole life. From a very young age, I became fascinated with music, and from the first live show I attended, I became intrigued with the aspect of it. To this day, I still attend many concerts a year, and spend hours upon hours daily listening to music and the beauty of its content. </p>

        <p>Putting on a show on a scale comparable to the ones I've attended became my goal in life. I knew that that would be what I would want to do someday as a career. So, one day, I would like to be the man behind the scenes that orchestrated the entire creative aspect of the show. I take inspiration from live music's greatest creatives, and found that lighting was the way to go for me.</p>
